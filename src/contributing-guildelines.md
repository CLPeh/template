## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?
If you have questions about how to use .NET Core, please read the [.NET Core Overview](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/core/dotnet-core) 
or ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net-core). There are thousands of .NET Core questions on 
Stack Overflow with the [.NET Core](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net-core) tag.

GitLab issues are only for [reporting bugs](#issue) and [feature requests](#feature), not questions or help.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by
submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix.

When submitting an issue please include the following information:

- A description of the issue
- The C#, classes, and .NET Core code related to the issue
- The exception message and stacktrace if an error was thrown
- If possible, please include code that reproduces the issue. You could
[submit a pull request](#pullrequest) with the issue reproduced in a new test.

The more information you include about the issue, the more likely it is to be fixed!


## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?

## <a name="pullrequest"></a> Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request to the [GitHub Repository][github] make sure to do the following:

- Check that new and updated code follows .NET Core's existing code formatting and naming standard
- Run .NET Core's unit tests to ensure no existing functionality has been affected
- Write new unit tests to test your changes. All features and fixed bugs must have tests to verify
they work
